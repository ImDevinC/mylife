# MyLife
This tool is a way to track certain aspects of my life that I want to record. It's heavily based off of [Felix Krause's](https://github.com/KrauseFx) [FxLifeSheet](https://github.com/KrauseFx/FxLifeSheet). However I wanted to rewrite it in Go.

Currently the only functionality that exists is the Telegram bot which is designed to asked questions and then store the results in a database. Visualization and a website will come later.
